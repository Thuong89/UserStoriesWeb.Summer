# UserStoriesWeb.Summer

This is a web project using HTML,CSS to build a User Story Web page. Techniques applied in this project are:
- Control and organize elements
- Embed image, image caption
- Flex box
- Embed URL link & open in new tab
- General adjustment: color, size, padding, etc.

Content is written by me, but image is taken from the internet.
